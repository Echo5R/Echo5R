#I’m Tyler

I’m an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner transitioning into DevOps / CloudOps, with a strong background in troubleshooting, system reliability, and operational leadership.

Before moving into cloud and backend development, I spent nearly a decade working hands-on with complex, mission-critical systems — diagnosing failures, restoring uptime, and preventing repeat issues. That same mindset now drives how I approach cloud infrastructure and backend systems: observe, isolate, fix, automate, and improve.
